# Python Coding Assessment

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to a Python coding assessment designed to evaluate fundamental Python concepts. The tasks cover various topics, including basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Structure

- `assessment.py`: Contains all the code for the functions and classes required by the assessment. The script also includes test cases that are executed when the script is run.

## Topics Covered

- Basic Data Structures
- Functions
- Decorators
- Sequences
- Sets and Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Tasks

### 1. Function: `add_numbers` (2 points)
Write a Python function that returns the sum of two numbers.

### 2. Function: `is_even` (2 points)
Write a Python function that checks if a number is even.

### 3. Function: `reverse_string` (2 points)
Write a Python function that returns the reversed version of a string.

### 4. Function: `count_vowels` (2 points)
Write a Python function that counts the vowels in a string.

### 5. Function: `calculate_factorial` (2 points)
Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

### 6. Function: `apply_decorator` (1 point)
Write a Python function that applies a decorator to another function.

### 7. Sequences: `Sort List of Tuples` (1 point)
Write a Python function that sorts a list of tuples by age.

### 8. Sets and Dictionaries: `merge_dicts` (1 point)
Write a Python function that merges two dictionaries.

### 9. Object-Oriented Programming: `Class Creation` (2 points)
Define a Python class representing a car with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and implement a method to display the car's information.

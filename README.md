# Python Coding Assessment

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to a Python coding assessment designed to evaluate fundamental Python concepts. The tasks cover various topics, including basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Structure

- `assessment.py`: Contains all the code for the functions and classes required by the assessment. The script also includes test cases that are executed when the script is run.

## Topics Covered

- Basic Data Structures
- Functions
- Decorators
- Sequences
- Sets and Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Tasks

### 1. Function: `add_numbers` (2 points)
Write a Python function that returns the sum of two numbers.

### 2. Function: `is_even` (2 points)
Write a Python function that checks if a number is even.

### 3. Function: `reverse_string` (2 points)
Write a Python function that returns the reversed version of a string.

### 4. Function: `count_vowels` (2 points)
Write a Python function that counts the vowels in a string.

### 5. Function: `calculate_factorial` (2 points)
Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

### 6. Function: `apply_decorator` (1 point)
Write a Python function that applies a decorator to another function.

### 7. Sequences: `Sort List of Tuples` (1 point)
Write a Python function that sorts a list of tuples by age.

### 8. Sets and Dictionaries: `merge_dicts` (1 point)
Write a Python function that merges two dictionaries.

### 9. Object-Oriented Programming: `Class Creation` (2 points)
Define a Python class representing a car with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and implement a method to display the car's information.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.12

## How to Run the Application

To run the Python assessment script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Move into the project directory where the assessment.py file is located:
bash
cd <your-repository-directory>

Run the Script:
Execute the Python script to run the tests for each function:
bash
python assessment.py

Expected Output
When you run the script, it will execute the test cases for each function and class, and print the results to the terminal.
